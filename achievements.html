        <h2>Notable Projects</h2>
        <div class="project-box">
            <h3>Fuel Adulteration Sensor</h3>
            <p>One of my most impactful projects is the development of a fuel adulteration sensor, which detects the presence of adulterants in fuel. The project, which I completed as part of my final-year thesis, aimed to combat the rampant issue of fuel adulteration that not only affects vehicle performance but also leads to environmental pollution. Using sensor technology and embedded systems, I created a device capable of analyzing fuel samples in real-time and providing accurate results on adulterant levels.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project Scope: Detection of fuel adulterants (such as kerosene in petrol) using sensor-based technology.</li>
                <li>Tools and Technologies: Microcontrollers, sensors, Python for data analysis, and embedded systems.</li>
                <li>Impact: The project has the potential to improve fuel quality control mechanisms and reduce the negative economic and environmental impacts of adulterated fuel.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project deepened my expertise in instrumentation and real-time data processing, and it highlighted the role of technology in solving pressing real-world problems. I plan to further develop this project with the goal of making it commercially viable.</p>

            <h3>Coding Competition - 2nd Place</h3>
            <p>In a recent coding competition, I secured second place by developing a Python-based application that automated repetitive tasks for small businesses. The experience not only tested my coding skills but also inspired me to continue developing automation tools to enhance efficiency in various sectors.</p>
